## Instructions

### This project currently runs on your local computer using node.js so download the repo files to test it for yourself.
*************************************************

Once downloaded, open the node application in your terminal by typing in `node app.js`. This should then prompt you with a few questions some required and some skippable that based on your input when finished should generate a styled HTMl page in the dist directory of this projects root file system. Good luck and I hope you enjoy this amazing work.
